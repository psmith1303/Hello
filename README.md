# hello

My first go programme. It doesn't do much other than run a wee webserver that responds with "Hello, world!".

## Getting started

Download the code, and compile it with

```
go build -x
```

And then you can run it, e.g.:

```
./hello
```

## Testing

As I said, this runs as a webserver. To test, try:

```
 curl -l http://localhost:8080
```
